      My day job is recipes. As the food editor of The New York Times and the
      founding editor of NYT Cooking, I spend a lot of time laying out strict
      instructions for how best to prepare specific dishes. These recipes take a
      particular form: a list of ingredients followed by step-by-step directions
      for how to use them. I think of these recipes as sheet music, a form of
      notation that allows home cooks to recreate the cooking of others.

      But I don’t just cook with recipes, and I am not alone. Indeed, cooking
      without recipes is a kitchen skill same as cutting vegetables into dice.
      It’s a way to improve your confidence in the kitchen and to make the act
      of cooking fun when sometimes it seems like a chore.

      Every Wednesday for the past four years, I have published on The New York
      Times one of these no-recipe recipes. What follows are some highlights
      from our archive of them, suggestions for things you might cook yourself,
      without a recipe.
